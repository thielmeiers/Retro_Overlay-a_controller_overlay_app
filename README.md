# 🚀 Installation

## To run the actual overlay, all you need is the exe file in the dist folder

## Clone the Repository and download python along with the necessary dependencies if you want to try to make your own controller overlay, just leave it in the skins folder (same folder that default.py and gamecube.py are in).

# Plans

## I honestly don't know how far I plan to take this right now, but I don't plan to stop adding things anytime soon.
## Besides cleaning the code up some more, I am also working on a way to have the controller input control mouse movement, the testing code I have for that is in this version of the project. Just run the the python file directly from the cmd line to test.
